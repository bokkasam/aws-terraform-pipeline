# aws-terraform-pipeline

In summary, this GitHub Actions workflow is intended to be manually triggered by a user through the GitHub UI. It checks out the repository, installs a specific version of Terraform, sets AWS authentication credentials from secrets, and verifies the installed Terraform version. Further steps for Terraform initialization, planning, and applying changes to infrastructure would typically be added to this workflow depending on the specific infrastructure management tasks you want to perform with Terraform.
